We have created, compiled and evaluated a model that can predict
financial timeseries, using a type of neural network called Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM), which is a particular type of Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN). The dataset used was a snippet of a larger one that has
been used for the M3 Competition. Our model was able to predict it with
an accuracy of 29.90%.
